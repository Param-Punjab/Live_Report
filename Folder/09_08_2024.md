## [Check_SYS_INFO]()

**Time: 20:30**
- **Activity:** Initiated vimtutor version 1.7.
- **Details:** On the welcome page, VIM was introduced as a versatile and powerful text editor. The tutorial highlighted the importance of practicing commands on a copy of the text to prevent unintended modifications. It advised using the "J" key to move downwards in the editor, which would be the first key learned for navigation.

**Time: 20:36**
- **Lesson 1.1: Moving the Cursor**
- **Details:**
  - **Movement Commands:**
    - **"h"**: Move cursor left.
    - **"l"**: Move cursor right.
    - **"k"**: Move cursor up.
    - **"j"**: Move cursor down.
  - **Advanced Tip:** Holding down "J" allows for rapid downward movement. This lesson demonstrated basic cursor navigation within the text and prepared for moving on to more advanced commands in Lesson 1.2.

**Time: 20:42**
- **Lesson 1.2: Exiting VIM**
- **Details:**
  - **Normal Mode:** Accessed by pressing `<ESC>`.
  - **Exiting Commands:**

**Time: 20:47**
- **Lesson 1.3: Text Editing - Deletion**
- **Details:**
  - **Deletion Command:**
    - **"X"**: Deletes the character under the cursor in Normal mode.

- **Details:**
  - **Appending Command:** "A" key to enter Append mode, allowing text to be added after the current cursor position.

**Time: 21:09**
- **Lesson 1.6: Editing a File**
- **Details:**
  - **Saving and Quitting:**

**Time: 21:33**
- **Lesson 2.4: Using a Count for a Motion**
- **Details:**
  - **Forward Movement Commands:**
    - **"xw"**: Move forward by x words (e.g., "2w" for two words).
    - **"xe"**: Move forward to the end of the word x times (e.g., "2e" for two words).
