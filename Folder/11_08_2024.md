   ca-certificates is already the newest version (20240203).
   You might want to run 'apt --fix-broken install' to correct these.

   Error: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt --fix-broken install' with no packages (or specify a solution)
   ```

3. **Fix Broken Dependencies**  
   Command: `sudo apt --fix-broken install`

5. **Prepare for Docker Installation**  
   - **Create Directory for Docker Keys**  
     Command: `sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings`  
   - **Add Docker GPG Key**  
     Command: `sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc`

6. **Add Docker Repository**  
   Command:  
   ```
   echo \
     "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
     $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
     sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
   ```

7. **Update Package Index Again**  
   Command: `sudo apt-get update`  
   **Output:**  
   ```
   Hit:1 https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com stable InRelease
   Hit:2 https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable InRelease
   Ign:3 https://apt.packages.shiftkey.dev/ubuntu any InRelease
   Hit:4 http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling InRelease
   Ign:5 https://download.docker.com/linux/debian kali-rolling InRelease
   Err:6 https://download.docker.com/linux/debian kali-rolling Release
     404  Not Found [IP: 108.158.245.93 443]
   Ign:3 https://apt.packages.shiftkey.dev/ubuntu any InRelease
   ```

8. **Issue Identified:**  
   - **Docker Repository Problem:** The URL for Docker's kali-rolling repository is returning a 404 error, meaning it is not available.
   - **Shiftkey Repository Error:** There is an SSL certificate issue with the Shiftkey repository.

9. **Solution:**  
   - **Update Docker Repository URL:** Since kali-rolling is not supported, change the repository to a compatible Debian version, like bullseye.

10. **Update Docker Repository File**  
    Command:  
    ```
    sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
    ```
    Update to:  
    ```
    deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian bullseye stable
    ```

11. **Retry Package Index Update**  
    Command: `sudo apt-get update`  
    **Note:** Re-run the update command to check if the new repository URL resolves the issue and allows Docker installation.

**Summary:**  
- Faced issues with Docker installation due to unsupported repository URLs and package dependency problems.
- Fixed broken dependencies and updated the Docker repository URL to use Debian bullseye.
- Plan to retry Docker installation commands after adjusting the repository.

**Next Steps:**  
1. Ensure Docker repository URL is correct and compatible with Debian bullseye.
2. Retry the Docker installation commands to complete the setup.
